<h1>Concordion.NET</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="https://concordion.org/tutorial/csharp/html/">Concordion.NET framework</a>
    brings together testing and specification.
    Concrete examples of expected behavior (written in HTML) can be
    instrumented with Concordion commands that run tests against the
    real system via fixture code.
    Fixtures helps to decouple the specs from the system under test.
</p>
<p>
    These executable specifications you find here are used for the
    development of Concordion.NET. They show how you can use the features
    of this framework. Additionally, they can be used as real world
    examples of Concordion.NET itself.
